Jenisha Harrison was a twiiter account which then lead to jennishappy- an instagram account.
On further looking into the posts of the accound i found a strange socket which was rather unfamiliar to me and had no connections to rest of the posts on that account.
So on google searching the image, found out that it was an Italian company. hence italy was the flag.
