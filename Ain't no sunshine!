Simply had to connect the componets to the breadboard based on the circuit diagram given which revealed the flag.
I took some time to clear this beacuse it was my first time using a breadboard and making connections based on diagram. The top part had horizontal connections while the middle part had vertical connections and you join two vertical using a wire to make the circuit complete.
