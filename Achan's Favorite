after reading the description and identifying that it was an audio file and it must be decoded or something.
so i looked and identified that it was an application of audio steganography.
So i downloaded an audio editor Audacity and inserted the audio file which then showed the image of steven he with emotional damage under it.
So i inputed both emotional damage and steven he as flags and surely enough steven he turned out to be the flag.
