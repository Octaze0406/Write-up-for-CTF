Connected the arduino board to the lap .
The task to extract the firmware from an arduino was made less harder using chatgpt.
executed the final code "sudo avrdude -p m329p -c arduino -P/dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 -U flash:r:firmware.hex:i " to extract the Firmware.
Converted hex file to bin file and used grep function to get the flag.
